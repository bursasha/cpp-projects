I learned the basics of object-oriented programming and learned 
how to use, specify, and implement abstract data types (stack, queue, 
expandable array, set, table). The programming language is C++. ⌨️

I also learned all the features of C++ important for the fulfillment of the different goals 
(e.g. templates, copying/moving objects, overloading operators,...). 🔧

In the university (ČVUT FIT) module I was taught the basics of C++ with selected parts of its standard 
library more precisely selected language structures and library functions 
from modern C++ standards. 👨🏽‍💻
